# Hangman-Game

# Project Description
This was an early coding project, the result of which is a more detailed variant of the game "hangman."<br>

The game has a dark theme, and is set during the 30 Years War, with the user as a prisoner required to guess a password.<br>
On further reflection, the theme can be considered to be in poor taste; my interest was in the historical period.<br> 

I spent considerable time focusing on design elements and tracking down/adapting period-specific images, fonts, etc.<br> 
Ultimately, far too much time/effort was expended on attempts at historical accuracy, and Javascript/functionality were an afterthought.<br> 
This lesson was internalized and applied to later projects.<br>

# Notes
This project would benefit from a re-visitation at a later date.<br>
