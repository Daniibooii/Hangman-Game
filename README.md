# Hangman-Game

# Project Description
This was an early coding project, the result of which is a more detailed variant of the game "hangman."<br>

The game has a dark theme, and is set during the 30 Years War, with the user as a prisoner required to guess a password.<br>
On further reflection, the theme can be considered to be in poor taste; my interest was in the historical period.<br>

# How to Use
First, open up index.html in your browser of choice.<br>
Next, you'll play a rather straight-forward game of hangman.<br>
Do your best to guess the word!<br>

# Notes
This project would benefit from a re-visitation at a later date.<br>
