# Hangman-Game

This was an early HW assignment. I spent considerable time focusing on design elements and tracking down/adapting period-specific images, fonts, etc. The resulting game would have been pretty dark, with a setting during the 30 Years War, with the user as a prisoner required to guess a password, lest he find upself up in a very famous tree. On further reflection, the theme can be considered to be in poor taste; my interest was in the historical period. Ultimately, far too much time/effort was expended on attempts at historical accuracy, and Javascript/functionality were an afterthought. This lesson was internalized and applied to succeeding assignments. 

This assignment would benefit from a re-visitation at a later date.
